# Movement speeds ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Long moves are faster than the small ones and used for the bulk of the bowden movement. Note that you can set two fast load
# speeds depending on whether MMU thinks it is pulling from the buffer or from the spool. It is often helpful to use a lower
# speed when pulling from the spool because more force is required to overcome friction and this prevents loosing steps.
# 100mm/s should be "quiet" with the NEMA14 motor or a NEMA17 pancake, but you can go lower for really low noise
# NOTE: Encoder cannot keep up much above 250mm/s so make sure `bowden_apply_correction` is off at very high speeds!
